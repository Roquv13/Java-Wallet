2. **User Profiles**:
   - Allow users to manage their profiles, including updating personal information, changing passwords, and setting preferences.

4. **Balances and Transactions**:
   - Implement functionality to view wallet balances, transaction history, and the ability to send/receive funds.

5. **Transaction History**:
   - Store and display transaction history, including transaction details, dates, and confirmations.
